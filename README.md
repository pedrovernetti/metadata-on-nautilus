# Metanautilus

Metanautilus is a python extension for [Nautilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Files) (GNOME File Manager, usually shipped with Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu) which makes many details (metadata) from files visible on list view.

### Characteristics

* __All__ and every metadata fetched from __local__ files is __cached__, so that from the second time you open the same folder onwards, there will be no overhead to display the information;
* __Any changes__ made to any file are __automatically considered__, since each cache entry is stored together with the time of its last modification (_st_mtime_);
* Files smaller than __16B__ are automatically __ignored__ to save time;
* Files in [__Samba__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)) shares and [__MTP__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol) devices are __fully supported__, being the caching functionality unavailable for these, however;
* Only tries fetching any infomartion other than the Index Node from regular files and symbolic links, skipping special files to save time;
* Non-local files bigger than 256MB have only their Index Node fetched, too;
* The cached information is periodically stored in two separate files at `~/.cache/metanautilus/` by a daemon thread: `known-junk` (list of known ignorable files) and `known-metadata` (already fetched metadata).
